# draft-e-shop-example
In progress, creating a web app example for online shopping called Shoppaneer. Used technologies:

- Spring boot for backend
- React for frontend
- MongoDB as a database
- CSS for design

The app will contain shopping news/ads about sales, coupons and new collections and also the customers will be able to browse and buy items for men, women and kids. Users will be able to have a profile in order to collect points and get discounts and the app will also have an admin who will manage items, users and other stuff. Amazon SQS service will also be added to queue orders/purchases.
